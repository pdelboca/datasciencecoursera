# QUIZ 1

# Question 1
# Which of the following are steps in building a machine learning algorithm?

# Asking the right question. 

# Question 2
# Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate 
# on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a 
# new data set?

# Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise. 

#Question 3
#What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

# 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set. 

# Question 4
# What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)?

# Accuracy 


# Question 5
# Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

# 9%
